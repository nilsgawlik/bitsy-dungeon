## Bitsy Dungeon Crawler ##

I am writing a dungeon crawler that uses [bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) as a game engine. It uses a bitsy hack to add extra features such as procedural dungeon generation.

This repo contains everything needed for building the project using grunt.js. The dungeon hack is contained within the bitsy-hack submodule which is a fork of [the bitsy-hacks repo](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks), more specifically in bitsy-hacks/src/dungeon-hack.js.
